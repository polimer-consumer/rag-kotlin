    "context": "class ClosedSendChannelException(message: String?) : IllegalStateException(source)  \nIndicates an attempt to send to a isClosedForSend channel that was closed without a cause. A failed channel rethrows the original close cause exception on send attempts.  \nThis exception is a subclass of IllegalStateException, because, conceptually, it is the sender's responsibility to close the channel and not try to send anything thereafter. Attempts to send to a closed channel indicate a logical error in the sender's code.",
